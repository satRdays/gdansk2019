description: "<br><p align='left'>The structure and therefore function of proteins are encoded in the linear sequence of amino acids. Our toolkit, the biogram R package, provides a set of useful tools for encoding protein sequences into features understandable by machine learning algorithms. Our software, inspired by natural language processing, extracts n-grams of amino acids from proteins and selects only the most informative ones using developed by us Quick Permutation Test (QuiPT). We present advantages of our approach using AmyloGram, an R package and shiny server (link) for prediction of amyloids, proteins associated with the number of clinical disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's and Huntington's diseases). Amyloid proteins are extremely diverse sequence-wise, but all of them can undergo a unique self-aggregation. AmyloGram effectively recognizes patterns responsible for this behavior (AUC = 0.8972) outperforming existing amyloid-predicting software. Moreover, predictions of AmyloGram were verified experimentally as our tool led to the discovery of a novel amyloid protein, MspA, produced by Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1.
