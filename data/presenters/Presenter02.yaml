description: "<br><p align='left'>Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) is a simple and high-throughput method common in research,
 forensics, and medicine. The popularity of qPCR resulted in the plethora of software devoted to the analysis of qPCR data, 
 including R packages. Despite that fact, there are no methods for automated assessment of qPCR results. 
 Thus, we propose the predPCR tool for reproducible classification of qPCR data. 
 Our model benefits not only from advancements in machine learning, as Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters, 
 but also from theoretical advancements in the field of qPCR analysis. 
 A combination of these two factors results in a powerful (AUC ~ 0.95 )yet simple to interpret model. 
 We present the complete analytical workflow, along with supplementary tools explaining the decision-making process 
 of predPCR tailored for users less fluent in machine learning. The machine learning approach enabled reliable, scalable, 
 and automated qPCR curve classification with broad potential clinical and epidemiological applications.
