description: "<br><p align='left'>With the continuous development of machine learning packages in R, statistical classification algorithms have been widely preferred to learn the performance of discrete label output (groups) with the help of these packages in many fields. On the other hand, researchers can confronted with some data sets which have no groups while it is available to be grouped by many other statistical methods. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), is a non-parametric method based on linear programming principles, can generate the grouped data as efficient and inefficient. 

It is also important to evaluate this grouping results with classification algorithms. As it is known, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine the algorithms are most widely used classification methods in literature. 

With this respect, we aimed to compare these classification performances on DEA grouping result. First, we obtained data set from Social Progress Index includes data from only 123 non-OECD countries on 7 indicators which consist of undernourishment (% of population; 5 signifies â‰¤5), depth of food deficit (calories/undernourished person), deaths from infectious disease (deaths/100.000), traffic deaths (deaths/100.000), greenhouse gas emission (CO2 equivalents per GDP), maternal mortality deaths (deaths/100.000 live births), and life expectancy (at years). The undernourishment, depth of food deficit, deaths from infectious disease, and traffic deaths were considered as related indicators on life expectancy. Second, we constructed an input oriented Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) model (Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes, 1978), where the life expectancy is output and other indicators are inputs. As a result, efficient and inefficient countries were obtained in terms of these indicators using Benchmarking package in R. 

Finally, we evaluated the grouping results in terms of accuracy rate using several classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine on this grouped data set using glm, keras , caret packages in R. </p> <br/>
