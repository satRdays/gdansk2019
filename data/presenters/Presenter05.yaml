Building Machine Learning models seems to be simple. We have many easily applicable
libraries for different purpose functions. However, it does not always turn out that our models
bring the expected results. Sometimes it even happens that the learned model on the training
set is evaluated high, and after testing on new sets, it incorrectly assesses the reality.
Tuning hyperparameters and modeling by re-sampling the sample data and performing
inferences on the sample from the re-tested data may be a solution to improve the quality of
already built models. The main advantage of such bootstrap samples is the measurability of
inference based on a real sample from the re-tested data.
