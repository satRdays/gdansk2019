description: "<br><p align='left'>Plumber makes it possible to easily transform your R functions into an API. Developing and testing the API locally is simple, but deploying it can be more of a challenge. Docker provides just what you need to ensure that the API is launched in a well defined, stable and isolated environment. These are some of the handiest tools to have in your toolbox!

                                  This short talk will show how to:

                                <p> - whip up a quick API by merely decorating your existing R code with comments, then </p>
                                <p> - write a simple Dockerfile to provide a runtime environment and finally </p>
                                <p> - deploy the API in the cloud. </p>

                                  All of this in the timeframe of a lightning talk. Booya!
