 <br><p align='left'>Sometimes you want to draw a ROC curve while not having a classification model (yet). For example: you consider investing in a new credit scoring system. You hear you may increase your AUROC (area under ROC) by 5 percentage points. In order to translate it into financial results, you need to draw a nonexistent ROC curve.

I will review available options of modelling ROC curves for credit scoring and show which fit the real data best.</p> <br/>
