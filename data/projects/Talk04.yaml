description: "

 <br><p align='left'>In the medical research different kinds of patient information are gathered over time
together with clinical outcome data such as overall survival (OS). Joint models enable
analysis of correlated data of different types such as individual repeated data together with
OS. The repeated data may be recurrent events e.g., appearance of new lesions or a
longitudinal outcome called biomarker e.g., tumor size. Moreover, joint models are useful
for individual dynamic predictions of death using a patient’s history. The talk will introduce
joint frailty models for recurrent events and a terminal event as well as present a
multivariate joint model for longitudinal marker, recurrent events and survival in the
context of treatment evaluation in cancer clinical trials. Presentation of implementing these
methods will be given using the R package frailtypack.</p> <br/>

<p align='left'> Agnieszka Król graduated in Mathematics at Politechnika Gdańska. She did her PhD training
in Biostatistics at University of Bordeaux on development and applications of statistical
models to the analysis of survival and longitudinal data coming from clinical trials on cancer
treatment evaluation. As a postdoctoral research fellow she continued her research in
correlated survival outcomes analysis at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute (LTRI)
at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto and, currently, at AstraZeneca. In parallel, she develops
statistical software (R packages) for proposed methods and publish them for other
researchers. Mother of two wonderful kids: two-year-old girl and 7-month-old boy.</p>"
