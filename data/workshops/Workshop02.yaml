description: "With the release of the R Keras package (https://keras.rstudio.com/) (by JJ Allaire and Francois Chollet) at the end of 2017 / beginning 2018 the topic of artificial neural networks and especially deep learning in R became red-hot within the R community.

              In this workshop you will get answers for the following questions:
              • What are fully connected and convolutional neural networks ?
              • How to build a sequential model in Keras (keras_model_sequential() function) ?
              • How to compile and fit neural networks in Keras (compile() and fit() functions) ?
              • How to add regularization to neural networks (L1, L2, dropout) ?
              • How to save and load existing models ?
              • How to perform data ingestion and augmentation using generators ?
              • How to use pre-trained models and perform fine-tuning ?
              • How to use callbacks ?

              Please make sure to bring your laptop including an up to date R version, RStudio and install Keras:

              Setup Keras (Make sure to install required prerequisites, before installing Keras using the commands below)
              install_keras() # CPU version
              install_keras(tensorflow = 'gpu') # GPU version (recommended)

        I’m a Data Scientist and a freelancer working primarily in R. In a last 3+ years I was working for companies like Appsilon Data Science, Grupa Wirtualna Polska and PBS when I was solving complicated machine learning problems and building advanced Shiny applications. Nowadays I’m interested mostly in deep learning and it’s applications.
